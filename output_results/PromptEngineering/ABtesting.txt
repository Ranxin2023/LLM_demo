📊 COMPLEX A/B TEST RESULTS

Prompt A:
Relevance:   0.825
Conciseness: 1.070
Readability: 0.540
➡️ Final Score: 0.841

Output:
Knowledge Distillation is a technique for model compression in which a smaller, faster student model learns to replicate the behavior of a larger teacher model. This is achieved by minimizing the differences between their predicted probability distributions, enabling the deployment of efficient models in real-world applications while maintaining a high level of accuracy.

Prompt B:
Relevance:   0.863
Conciseness: 1.010
Readability: 0.813
➡️ Final Score: 0.897

Output:
- Knowledge Distillation involves a smaller student model learning to replicate the behavior of a larger teacher model for model compression.
- The technique minimizes the divergence between the predicted probability distributions of the teacher and student models to transfer knowledge effectively.
- This approach enables the deployment of efficient models in real-world applications while maintaining high accuracy levels.

Prompt C:
Relevance:   0.849
Conciseness: 0.160
Readability: 1.000
➡️ Final Score: 0.672

Output:
Knowledge Distillation is a technique for compressing models, where a smaller, faster student model learns from a larger teacher model. The practical benefits include:

1. **Efficiency**: Smaller models require less computational power and memory, making them suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones and IoT devices.

2. **Speed**: The student model can make predictions more quickly than the teacher model, enhancing user experience in applications that require real-time processing.

3. **Maintained Accuracy**: By mimicking the teacher model, the student can achieve comparable accuracy, allowing for effective use in scenarios where performance is critical.

4. **Scalability**: Knowledge Distillation enables the deployment of AI solutions at scale, as smaller models can handle a larger number of requests simultaneously.

Use-cases include mobile applications, edge computing, and scenarios where low latency and resource efficiency are essential, such as autonomous vehicles and real-time analytics.
