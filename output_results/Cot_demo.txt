CoT Function......
Response in coTFunctionTo calculate the average speed of the car in miles per hour (mph), we use the formula for average speed:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

1. **Identify the total distance** traveled by the car: 
   - The car travels **60 miles**.

2. **Identify the total time** taken for the trip:
   - The time taken for the trip is **1.5 hours**.

3. **Substitute the distance and time into the formula**:
   - Plugging in the values we have:
   
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   - To divide 60 by 1.5, we can convert 1.5 to a fraction (1.5 = 3/2) or simply perform the division directly.
   - Performing it directly:
   
   \[
   60 \div 1.5 = 40
   \]

So, the average speed of the car is **40 miles per hour (mph)**.
