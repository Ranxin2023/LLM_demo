To find the average speed of the car in miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

In this case, the total distance the car traveled is 60 miles, and the total time it took to travel that distance is 1.5 hours.

Now, we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}}
\]

Next, we perform the division:

To divide 60 by 1.5, it may be helpful to convert 1.5 into a fraction or perform the calculation. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 1.5 directly. Alternatively, we can convert 1.5 to a fraction:

\[
1.5 = \frac{15}{10} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

So we can rewrite the division:

\[
\frac{60}{1.5} = 60 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{60 \times 2}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
\]

Thus, the average speed of the car is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = 40 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

In conclusion, the average speed of the car is **40 miles per hour**.
