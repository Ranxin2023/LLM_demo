To calculate the average speed of the car in miles per hour (mph), we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

In this case, the total distance traveled is 60 miles, and the total time taken is 1.5 hours. Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}}
\]

Next, we perform the division:

1. Calculate \(60 \div 1.5\):
   \[
   60 \div 1.5 = 40
   \]

Thus, the average speed of the car is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = 40 \text{ miles per hour (mph)}
\]

Therefore, the average speed of the car is 40 mph.
